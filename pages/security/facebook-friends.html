<p>Adding someone you don’t know on Facebook may not only expose your private information , but it may also lead to the compromise of your account. Facebook recently added a new feature in which users may retrieve their account if they lost their password credentials.</p>
<p><br><br>
</p><h3>How?</h3>

<p>This process is based mainly on the knowledge of your account and a trust-based model of security, where Facebook requires your ‘friends’ to prove your authenticity. The process is fairly simple. Facebook will let choose 3 trusted friends in which they will send a ‘secret’ number to them. By entering these codes, the user will be able to complete the process of password recovery.</p>
<p>This is where the main problem lies. If a Facebook user adds at least 3 different and very beautiful young lady friends, which happens to be owned by a malicious user, his account can be compromised through the new password recovery feature.</p>

<h3><strong>Will users really add someone they don’t know?</strong></h3>
<p>I’d like to think that the answer to this is a ‘yes’. However, I have been proven wrong on several accounts. A while ago, I had a few friends who created a Facebook user with the name “Ah Long” (which is a common male name of a loan shark/illegal money lender), with a gender of female (Really… any more obvious?).</p>
<p>They went around adding people on the social network from a single institute. The results were shocking. Within a few days, we got 500-1000 users from the school who accepted our friend requests. I was appauled to know that some of the victims were my personal friends.<br>
In addition, mutual friends also means that once several accounts in a network are compromised, the attacker has it easy.</p>

<h3><strong>Isn’t there already an additional layer of security in place?</strong></h3>
<p>A few months back, I completed this process for a friend that had his account compromised. Yes, indeed. Facebook has added an additional check which requires users to upload a copy of their identity card. Facebook also mentions that confidential information should be blanked out (i.e. SSNs, NRICs, etc.) – this gives me an impression they don’t check for photoshopped IDs.</p>
<p>In my opinion, it would be fairly easy to create a picture identification based on the user’s 500+ photos. If physical counterfeit IDs can be made, virtual ones should be a walk in the park.</p>
<h3><strong>How can we protect against this?</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>Be wary of people adding you (or vice versa). Always double-check and do housekeeping on friends (esp. those who may have been compromised)</li>
<li>Enable Facebook 2-factor authentication feature</li>
<li>Set and regularly review privacy settings (privacy policies change quite frequently and may result in leakage of data)</li>
</ol>
